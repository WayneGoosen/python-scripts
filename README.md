# python-scripts

A collection of adhoc scripts to help with daily tasks.

## GenerateGuid.py

There are a couple different ways to generate a Guid (SQL, Visual Studio or online tools). This script will generate a new Guid and put it on the clip board. 

## GenerateSnippet.py

I recently created a Visual Studio Code plugin with snippets and found the process a bit tedious. This script grabs some code you have copied, generates a snippet of it and puts it on the clip board.
